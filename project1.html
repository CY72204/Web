        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="portfolio-item">
            In this project, it is found that 74% of Toronto's population is within the maximum accessibility range to reach a hospital; 
            it takes emergency response (priority 2) patients approximately 2 days before they can receive healthcare services, 
            but it takes children (priority 4 patients) approximately 25 days before they can receive healthcare services. 
            Toronto’s maximum accessibility range percentage is comparable to Istanbul’s 
            maximum accessibility range percentage since both are major international cities and urban centres. 
            Spatial distance and wait times are used in combination to determine the accessibility of hospitals for the people of Toronto. 
            This is because accessibility, in this project, 
            is defined as whether a patient is within range to be able to reach a hospital and whether they are able to get access to the healthcare services in time for their needs, 
            be it treatments or emergency responses.
