        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="portfolio-item">
            In summary, a total of 78 single detached houses in rural Strathcona county are found to have been damaged by wildfires. 
            Based on calculations, the estimated average economic damages caused by wildfires is $49,686,000 CAD and the estimated median economic damages caused by wildfires is 
            $50,622,000 CAD. Wildfire polygons and building polygons in Edmonton were spatially joined using the Geopandas package. 
            The NBR and NDVI were assessed from Landsat 8 imagery. Information, such as building names and their property type, 
            were searched up in order to find the estimated economic damages caused by wildfires. 
            Limitations include that buildings and property value could not be analyzed directly with ArcGIS and Python. 
            Another limitation is the limited information available which has caused an exaggerated estimate of the economic impacts brought by wildfires. 
            Also, vectors are approximations of wildfires. There can be gaps within the wildfires left unscathed, but the polygons assume their areas are burned completely. 
            Rocks, bare soil, and water do not burn. Also, low severity fires may cause sub-canopy burn, or understory vegetation burn, 
            where the upper and continuous canopy of the forest stands cover the satelliteâ€™s view, so those fires are left unrecorded.
