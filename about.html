        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet! I am Chris Yeung, a recent graduate with a degree in Physical and Environmental Geography.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a passion for conducting geospatial data analysis, 
            and I’m excited to transition into the professional world, where I can apply the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired.</p>
        <h2>My Strengths and Experience</h2>
        <p>During my time at university, I engaged in various projects and internships that honed my abilities in data analysis, map-making, and problem-solving. 
            For instance, my team and I worked on creating a web map for locating restaurants of the users' selected cuisine in Toronto 
            which has helped me develop a strong foundation in data analysis. 
            In addition to my academic work, I am also proficient in tools, such as Python, HTML, Office, and G Suite, as well languages, 
            such as English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. My hands-on experience in these areas ensures I can quickly add value to any team I join.</p>
        <h2>Why I’m Excited to Work with You</h2>
        <p>I am actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to and grow within a dynamic company. 
            I’m particularly interested in roles that allow me to develop my skills and grow alongside my team and company. I thrive in collaborative environments, 
            and I’m eager to bring my fresh perspectives and strong work ethic to help drive meaningful results.</p>
        <h2>Reaching Out</h2>
        <p>I’m always excited to connect with like-minded people, whether it's to collaborate, share ideas, or just chat about shared interests. 
            Feel free to check my <a href="contact.html">contacts</a> to get into contact with me. Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
